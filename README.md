# Residential-Building-Sector-IMAGE/TIMER-

# Description
This repository includes the residential building sector sub-modules of TIMER (i.e., the energy model of IMAGE). These modules are translated from MyM to Python to become oper source material, and in cases are slightly modified to improve the documentation, and performance. 

# Installation 
1. Python package. 
2. PyM: These modules use key idicator's output from TIMER as input. For that reason PyM, a Python module/tool created by Maarten van de den Berg, has to be imported for the modules to run. PyM reads TIMER's output in Python.

# Project Status
This is an ongoing project in which all residential sector sub-modules from TIMER will be translated in Python.
It is expected to complete by the 30th April. 

# Licence 
Not yet available, but will be included in the future.
